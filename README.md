> Organizational Chart using d3.js

I need someone to help me develop an organizational chart in d3.js.

I need something like https://jsfiddle.net/augburto/YMa2y/. The nodes will additionally display a profile pic along with the employee designation and optional department. Upon hover on each node, the employee profile card (simple div with user details needs to be displayed).

The tree will start from top of the tree.

One additional feature in the chart is to provide the users to locate themselves on the tree. It can be like, a button can be provided to the logged in user. Upon clicking that button the tree can animate to user node with only that node expanded while other nodes are collapsed.

The user should be able to zoom in/out and drag the chart as in the example jsfiddle.

If the tasks goes well, I am planning to expand the project and add some additional features (will be paid separately).

Please feel free to ask if you have any doubts in the requirements.

##  Winning Proposal

Hi, I have seen your job and I liked it. So , I tried to implement your requests and modified your jsfiddle chart

1. I allowed user to zoom out
2. I have added image on square
3. I also have implemented to show logged user in a tree
4. I have added tooltip

Here is result

Off course it's ugly yet, but it will be more beautiful after I will work on it.
